HarvardXCapstone--- Movie Recommendation System

This capstone is project 1 out of 2 for the final course in the Harvard University Professional Certificate in Data Science.
The goal of the capstone projects are to utlilize skills gained in the program, including data visualization, predition, probability, inference
, data wrangling, data regression, and machine learning. The optimal goal is to create a recommendation system algorithm for the provided 
users that would effectively recommend movies based on provided features, and optimize the prediction with an RMSE score <= 0.87750.

For this project, I created a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. \
The version of movielens included in the dslabs package  is just a small subset of a much larger dataset with millions of ratings. 
I will use the 10M version of the MovieLens dataset to make the computation a little easier.

Background: Inspired by the popular Netflix Kaggle competition that challenged users to create an improved recommendation system
 (that improved the streaming company's then algorithm's error rate by at least 10%), this assignment aims to accomplish a similar task.
